# Train-Scheduler
Use this awesome app to find out when a train is coming.

Input a trains name, destination, frequency it runs and starting time.

When you hit the submit button, wait for magic.

In the Current Train Schedule table, it will show how many minutes until the next train arrives, and that trains arrival.

Enjoy :)
